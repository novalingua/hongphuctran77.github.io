In others, children focus on a narrow range of subjects related to a particular career. Which do you think is appropriate in today’s world? (Education)\nThere is an ongoing debate about the number of subjects students in secondary schools should learn. While some suggest a wide range of curriculum, others believe firmly that the subjects taught should be directly related to students\u0026rsquo; future careers.\nAt their age, many students are not informed enough to make decisions about their future career. This is exemplified by the fact that a large number of undergraduates change their majors every year. Although society may view them as fully-functioning adults capable of making major life decisions, psychologically speaking, the majority of 18-year-olds are still going through the process of self-discovery and thus are ill-equipped to choose the perfect career path that would maximize their potential. As a result, many would argue that restricting students to a narrow range of subjects would not necessarily benefit their adult lives, and could even be counter-productive in some cases.\nBy having access to a multitude of fields and disciplines, learners would have more opportunities to discover what they are passionate about. As each individual is different, some students would be better suited to a career in finance, while others would flourish in more artistic environments, and so on. Being exposed to different areas of learning has merits beyond their professional lives, too. Students can lead a more fulfilling life by learning about new passions and hobbies that may not have monetary value but are nonetheless entertaining and rewarding to pursue. Society must come to terms with the increased individualism of the modern age and the fact that people need interests outside of work in order to be truly satisfied. The availability of multiple fields of knowledge is therefore beneficial not only to the students who learn them but also to society at large.\nIn conclusion, students should not be limited to a predefined list of subjects that people deem important because the alternative is far superior and has many more upsides.\n(317 words, band 7)\n","date":"2023-02-04","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/range-of-subjects-sample/","section":"","summary":"In some countries, secondary schools aim to provide a general education across a range of subjects.

What are the reasons and solutions? (Environment)\nIn the post-modern era, the effects of environmental changes have become a pressing issue. One of the ways people can minimize their environmental impacts is through recycling. Sadly, in many nations and regions around the world, waste recycling is often overlooked.\nA large number of people do not take recycling seriously enough. Hundreds of thousands of tons of garbage head to landfills and incinerators every day, contributing greatly to air, water, and soil degradation. Many experts see this as an issue of awareness: the majority of these people are simply not cognizant of the damage they cause through their lack of recycling. Many others are somewhat conscious of the harmful effects of their actions, but fail to see the full picture and do not see the value in recycling or reusing materials. Therefore, solutions to this problem should be aimed at raising awareness of the problem and the ease of recycling, or giving people fewer opportunities to damage the environment.\nThere are a myriad of ways to encourage recycling. More specifically, at the federal level, there should be campaigns and legislation to combat environmental damage. The benefits and methods of recycling and reusing materials should be taught to all schoolchildren, and the disadvantages should be laid out clearly through national advertisements or newspapers. Furthermore, there should be laws mandating the separation of recyclable from non-recyclable waste. In some countries like Japan, residents must buy different trash bags for different types of garbage, and categorize their waste accordingly or risk facing fines. These, when combined with other measures, would inevitably reduce the amount of unnecessary waste dumped out into the environment.\nIn conclusion, a big contributor to the deficiency in waste recycling is a lack of awareness. To remedy this, steps should be taken at the government level.\n(296 words, band 7)\n","date":"2023-02-03","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/recycling-solutions-sample/","section":"","summary":"In some countries, there is not enough recycling of waste materials (e.g. paper, glass and cans).

Do the advantages of this trend outweigh its disadvantages?\nIn the Western world, the majority of fresh graduates choose to move out of their parents\u0026rsquo; house and start their independent lives. In contrast, Eastern adults usually live with their parents until they get married, even if they have found jobs and can afford to live alone. There are advantages and disadvantages to both of these approaches.\nThere are many upsides to living with one\u0026rsquo;s parents. Perhaps most notably, young people can retain their support system. Since the day their children were born, parents have stood behind their children and would continue to do so with no strings attached. Since residing alone is more costly than living with roommates, this will financially benefit young people by reducing living expenses. There are other merits as well, such as emotional support during tough times, or a lessened load of household tasks. Consequently, many Asian people opt to stay with their parents until the need to move out arises, such as when they start their own families.\nThe parents in this equation reap some benefits as well. Beyond the aforementioned psychological and economic benefits that go both ways in this living arrangement, parents also get to spend a longer amount of time with their sons and daughters before they leave the nest. Furthermore, as they get older, having caregivers when their health deteriorates is a major comfort, especially when those caregivers are family. Thus, the cohabitation of parents and children is a mutually beneficial relationship.\nAdmittedly, there are some downsides to living with your parents. As adults, everyone in the household will have their own opinions and personalities. From time to time, these opinions and personalities may clash, and when they do, these familial conflicts are harder to resolve than others, perhaps even more so when everybody is living under the same roof. Nevertheless, these drawbacks can easily go away if everyone adjusts their expectations and allows each other some room for understanding. Thereby, the negative aspects of parents and children living together can be mostly mitigated.\nIn conclusion, although the choice to live with one\u0026rsquo;s parents, even when one can afford to move out, comes with certain complications, they are far outweighed by the potential benefits.\n(363 words, band 6.5)\n","date":"2023-02-02","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/adults-living-with-parents-sample/","section":"","summary":"In some countries, more and more adults choose to continue to live with their parents after they graduate and have found jobs.

Chẳng hạn nếu các bạn viết IELTS Academic, mỗi dạng bài thường sẽ có nhiều loại dàn ý chi tiết như advantages/disadvantages, problem/solution, agree/disagree, v.v.\nMình khuyến khích các bạn tìm hiểu các dàn ý chi tiết này sau khi đã đạt khoảng band 6-6.5 để có thể cải thiện điểm cao hơn. Tuy nhiên, ở trình độ trung bình, người học hiếm khi hiểu được tại sao những dàn ý này hay, hay ở chỗ nào, v.v. để có thể áp dụng được vào bài viết của chính mình. Nên nhớ là IELTS Writing không bắt buộc các bạn viết theo một dàn ý nào cụ thể cả, quan trọng là các bạn trình bày bài viết như thế nào, có hợp lí không. Để dễ dàng bắt đầu viết hơn, những bạn chưa đạt được đến trình độ trung bình khá có thể tham khảo qua dàn ý P.E.E.L.\nĐiểm mạnh của dàn ý này là nó rất đơn giản, dễ hiểu, và đã rất nhiều giáo viên và học sinh áp dụng một cách hiệu quả, khiến cho bài viết trở nên mạch lạc, rõ ràng hơn. Do đó, các bạn chỉ cần nhớ và hiểu 1 dàn ý này là đủ.\nP.E.E.L là gì? P.E.E.L. (bóc vỏ) là viết tắt của 4 yếu tố: Point (luận điểm), Evidence (dẫn chứng), Explain (giải thích), Link (kết nối). Trong bài IELTS Academic Writing Task 2, mỗi yếu tố chỉ nên viết từ 1-2 câu để kịp thời gian.\nĐây đơn giản là một phương pháp viết giúp cho bài viết của người học có cấu trúc rõ ràng, đầy đủ và dễ hiểu, bao gồm cả việc đưa ra ý kiến của người viết và các dẫn chứng.\nPoint Point (luận điểm) thường là câu mở đầu của đoạn. Câu này cần thể hiện rõ ràng và ngắn gọn ý chính của cả đoạn, để người đọc có thể nhanh chóng hiểu ý chính của đoạn văn này là gì. Khi viết bài hoặc đọc lại bài, người viết nên tự hỏi rằng nếu chỉ đọc câu mở đoạn thì có hiểu đại khái đoạn văn nói cái gì hay không.\nEvidence Evidence (dẫn chứng) là nơi mà người viết đưa ra các dẫn chứng hoặc ví dụ cụ thể để chứng minh cho luận điểm của mình. Trong văn học thuật, khi đưa ra một ý kiến hay luận điểm nào đó, người viết cần phải chứng minh được ý kiến hay luận điểm đó. Cách dễ nhất và thuyết phục nhất là đưa ra dẫn chứng khoa học, cụ thể, liên quan. Luận điểm của người viết phải dựa trên các dữ liệu hay dẫn chứng thiết thực.\nKhi viết IELTS Writing, để dễ dàng hơn, trong lúc viết dàn ý các bạn nên suy nghĩ luôn là luận điểm của mình có dẫn chứng nào cụ thể hay không? Nếu không thì nên đổi sang luận điểm khác.\nExplain Sau khi đưa ra dẫn chứng, người viết nên Explain (giải thích) rõ ràng dẫn chứng của mình liên quan đến luận điểm ở chỗ nào, hay làm cách nào dẫn chứng của mình chứng minh cho luận điểm. Nói cách khác, người viết cần giải thích rằng dẫn chứng có ý nghĩa gì và tại sao dẫn chứng đó có giá trị.\nLink Câu cuối cùng của đoạn - Link (kết nối) - nên được dùng để chuyển ý sang đoạn tiếp theo. Tuy nhiên, trong bài IELTS Academic, do chỉ có 2 đoạn thân bài, nên nếu các bạn không thể chuyển ý, hãy sử dụng câu này như một câu kết đoạn: tóm tắt ý, khẳng định lại luận điểm. Việc kết nối ý giữa đoạn body 1 \u0026amp; 2 là nên, nhưng không bắt buộc.\nLưu ý Trong tùy trường hợp và tùy người viết, vị trí Evidence và Explain có thể đổi chỗ cho nhau.\nVí dụ cụ thể 1 đoạn văn điển hình của dàn ý P.E.E.L. gồm 4 câu:\nComputer games, like everything else, have many downsides, especially for children. Extended and unsupervised gaming sessions can cause many issues, ranging from physical ones such as nearsightedness and joint pain to psychological ones like addiction. These problems have the potential to adversely impact the lives of anyone, but they are especially damaging to children in their formative years. As such, excessive gaming is generally frowned upon by health experts, and it is recommended that parents should both limit the amount of time their children spend playing video games and keep an eye on the games they play.\n(nguồn)\nPoint Computer games, like everything else, have many downsides, especially for children.\nĐây là câu luận điểm ngắn gọn và dễ hiểu: Trò chơi điện tử có nhiều mặt xấu, đặc biệt là đối với trẻ em.\nEvidence Extended and unsupervised gaming sessions can cause many issues, ranging from physical ones such as nearsightedness and joint pain to psychological ones like addiction.\nLuận điểm của mình là \u0026ldquo;nhiều mặt xấu\u0026rdquo;, nên dẫn chứng là liệt kê ra các mặt xấu khi chơi game quá nhiều: cận thị, đau xương khớp, nghiện game.\nExplain These problems have the potential to adversely impact the lives of anyone, but they are especially damaging to children in their formative years.\nSau đó mình đi giải thích tại sao những thứ trong câu dẫn chứng có hại. Vậy, sau khi mình Explain tại sao Evidence có hại, người đọc có thể hiểu và đồng ý được Point.\nLink As such, excessive gaming is generally frowned upon by health experts, and it is recommended that parents should both limit the amount of time their children spend playing video games and keep an eye on the games they play.\nKhẳng định lại luận điểm là chơi game quá độ có hại cho sức khỏe.\nPhần \u0026ldquo;and it is\u0026hellip; the games they play\u0026rdquo; là để chốt luôn ý \u0026ldquo;extended and unsupervised\u0026rdquo; ở câu Evidence\nTổng kết Vậy, nhờ cấu trúc P.E.E.L., đoạn văn của các bạn sẽ đơn giản, đầy đủ hơn, không bị lan man dài dòng. Mỗi câu trong đoạn có chức năng riêng biệt và cùng phục vụ 1 mục đích là thuyết phục người đọc. Ngoài ra các bạn cũng không cần phải học quá nhiều dàn ý cụ thể cho mỗi dạng bài IELTS nữa.\n","date":"2023-02-02","permalink":"/posts/english-basics/peel-method/","section":"","summary":"Phương pháp viết essay đơn giản, hiệu quả.","title":"P.E.E.L.

This blog will mainly contain methods, tools, and resources for language acquisition, with the occasional personal blog post here and there. The language I\u0026rsquo;m teaching is English, but hopefully learners of other languages can find something useful here, too.\nWhy a blog I\u0026rsquo;m an English teacher/tutor, and I find myself wanting a permanent place to store and present my ideas.\nMy first blog was created with Ghost CMS, which was an excellent option. I hosted NEOLINGO on a VPS I rented and used BunnyCDN for caching. It was acceptably fast and optimized.\nHowever, I had 2 problems with this setup\nThe writing process on Ghost was only okay-ish, since I had to use their web interface to write and publish posts. Instead, I wanted a way to write and edit posts offline, using whatever writing tool I prefer. It\u0026rsquo;s faster, more convenient, and my workflow can be customized to my liking. Hosting costs. I had to rent a Virtual Private Server in the cloud, since Ghost CMS doesn\u0026rsquo;t play nice with shared hosting. Renting regional servers in Asia was more costly compared to servers in NA or EU, but servers in those regions are far away and thus performance suffers. This necessitated the use of a caching layer, for which I chose BunnyCDN, but that costs money too. Enter static site generators. Static sites are blazing fast and extremely lightweight, which makes the reading experience more enjoyable. More importantly, static site hosting is cheap or even free - since they\u0026rsquo;re so lightweight, which reduces my hosting costs. This blog is written in ObsidianMD, built using Hugo, and deployed via Netlify. All of these tools are free (for now), and writing in Obsidian is far better than writing in Ghost editor.\n","date":"2023-02-01","permalink":"/page/about/","section":"Pages","summary":"Welcome to NEOLINGO, a blog about language learning.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"2023-02-01","permalink":"/page/","section":"Pages","summary":"","title":"Pages"},{"content":"Some people think that using mobile phones and computers has a negative effect on young people\u0026rsquo;s reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nDigital devices such as phones and computers have been adopted worldwide, to the point where everybody now has at least one digital accessory that they use every day. However, some people, especially older generations, are of the opinion that this widespread adoption of technology is detrimental to the reading and writing proficiency of young people.\nThe theory that as technological literacy increases, proficiency in other skills decreases is quite prominent. Many people feel that as children and teenagers become addicted to their mobile devices, the development of valuable skills such as reading comprehension and creative writing is neglected. This is amplified by the fact that an alarming number of publications and social networks nowadays only care about the pure amount of clicks and views they can generate, and thus churn out meaningless, poorly-written posts and articles that are only designed to do just that - generate views. Hence, not only are reading and writing skills are not developed, they are actively made worse due to the consumption of bad content.\nNevertheless, this theory loses credibility somewhat when we look at the bigger picture. In many countries, the literacy rate is higher than ever before, and the amount of well-written books and articles have also increased significantly, albeit alongside poorly-written ones. Advances in user-friendly, accessible technology have made both learning and teaching easier, and people are becoming more and more well-educated as a result. Consequently, we can conclude that while there are admittedly some downsides to the heavy usage of mobile phones and computers, the overall impact it has on reading and writing skills is mostly positive and beneficial.\nTo summarise, though some people may think that the widespread adoption of devices like phones and computers negatively impacts reading and writing proficiency, this can be disproven when we look at the wider effect digital gadgets has had, especially regarding education.\n(307 words, band 7)\n","date":"2023-02-01","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/phone-effects-reading-writing/","section":"","summary":"Some people think that using mobile phones and computers has a negative effect on young people\u0026rsquo;s reading and writing skills.

To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Government)\nThe government budget and how to best utilize it has always been a contentious issue - because it is of a limited nature, it is crucial that we spend the budget as effectively as possible. Hence, when it comes to promoting sports and art, there are two prevalent school of thoughts: promoting them in school, and promoting them in communities.\nSchools are great places to foster sports and art, due to their inherent design as places of education. Promoting these extra-curriculum activities within an educational setting allows society to cultivate talents from a young age. What\u0026rsquo;s more, it enriches the lives of students, who would be given the opportunity to follow their interests and passions, and improve upon them. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find many flaws or downside to this approach. Everyone wins here - from students who are given the chance to develop themselves and to society in general, as we can better find and nurture talents.\nHowever, one should not overlook the effectiveness of promoting sports and art in communities, or the life improvement it brings. People who previously have not had the chance to discover their gifts or interests can do so, and thereby their lives and perhaps even society at large benefits from it. Firstly, we can both provide entertainment and inspire people to follow their passion, thereby discovering whether there are wasted or under-developed potential within themselves. Secondly, even if the number of transcendental or generational talents are few and far between, at least people can now lead happier and more fulfilling lives, which makes our society more productive as a whole. Therefore, it is equally important that we also find the opportunity to foster sports and art development in our local communities.\nIn conclusion, sports and art promotion is an important endeavour for any government around the world, and choosing between school or community promotion can be tough. That said, one should realize that it is not an either-or issue, and that we should strive to provide everyone, in every setting, with the opportunity to grow and advance not only their gifts but also their interests.\n(353 words, band 7-7.5)\n","date":"2023-01-31","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/promoting-sports-and-art-sample/","section":"","summary":"The government should spend money in promoting sport and art in school, rather than sponsoring professional sports and art events in communities.

To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Education)\nSince TV and computer games first became widely available to the public in the 20th century, people have claimed that playing computer games is detrimental to children, and that they should preferably read books instead. Be that as it may, as television and computer games develop and become more and more widespread, plenty of research has been done on the subject and they seem to suggest that watching TV and playing computer games may have at least some benefits.\nOpponents of digital entertainment insist that it ruins childhoods and that books are more beneficial to young minds. Indeed, when consumed without moderation, computers and TVs can be addictive and thus prevent children from doing other beneficial activities - such as playing sports, studying or socializing - all of which are fundamental in shaping a child\u0026rsquo;s development. Books, on the other hand, are far less addictive while being potentially every bit as entertaining as their digital alternatives. Nonetheless, these possible negative outcomes is only tangentially related to digital media itself; rather, they point to deeper problems such as the lack of self-control or inattentive caretakers. In other words, the undesirable impact of degital entertainment like television and computer games comes from excessive consumption, not from the medium. Thus, it is perhaps more practical to look past these purported downsides of digital media and determine if there are benefits to be had when compared to traditional book reading.\nThere are, in fact, numerous benefits that children can gain when playing video games. Researchers have observed a correlation between gaming and improved hand-eye coordination, forward planning and critical thinking. Furthermore, by design, television, movies, and video games are more immersive and compelling as story-telling devices - especially to young children. Because of the shorter attention span of children, the increased engagement can prove invaluable for educators and guardians in their efforts. Therefore, in certain situations and contexts, reading books is not necessarily better than watching television or playing computer games.\nIn conclusion, while books are undeniably a valuable tool in education and in children\u0026rsquo;s upbringing, one should not overlook the potential benefits of digital media such as television and video games, provided that they are consumed reasonably and responsibly.\n(363 words, band 7)\n","date":"2023-01-30","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/books-vs-tv-sample/","section":"","summary":"Some people think reading stories in books is better than watching TV or playing computer games for children.

Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nComputer games are said to be almost as old as computers themselves. However, the effect of computer games on the development of children is still unclear and hotly debated. While some say that computer games negatively affect children and should be avoided at all costs, others believe that computer games have a role to play in the development of children in the modern world.\nComputer games, like everything else, have many downsides, especially for children. Extended and unsupervised gaming sessions can cause many issues, ranging from physical ones such as nearsightedness and joint pain to psychological ones like addiction. These problems have the potential to adversely (=negatively) impact the lives of anyone, but they are especially damaging to children in their formative years. As such, excessive gaming is generally frowned upon by health experts, and it is recommended that parents should both limit the amount of time their children spend playing video games and keep an eye on the games they play.\nHowever, computer games may also bring benefits to the development of children. Various studies were able to measure a considerable increase in hand-eye coordination in children who spend at least some of their time playing video games compared to their peers who don\u0026rsquo;t play at all. Some games, such as strategy or puzzle games, can even teach children critical thinking and forward planning. Needless to say, these are beneficial skills and traits that can help children blossom and develop. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are also physical and mental benefits of computer games that can positively contribute to children\u0026rsquo;s growth.\nIn conclusion, while there are undoubtedly many potential problems that computer games can cause, they mainly stem from excessive and uncontrolled gaming. On the other hand, choosing the right games and playing them in moderation can have a lot of positive impact on children\u0026rsquo;s development.\n(309 words, band 6.5-7.0)\n","date":"2023-01-29","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/computer-games-pros-cons-sample/","section":"","summary":"Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect.

(VD: mỗi ngày học 20 từ thì tạo luôn 1 note 140 từ của tuần đó) Sử dụng flashcards để ôn từ vựng Chọn Review flashcards bên tay trái Trên điện thoại Android/iOS mở plugin bằng cách: Chọn biểu tượng 3 gạch ngang ở góc dưới cùng bên tay phải Chọn Review flashcards Chọn flashcards để ôn lại từ vựng trong tất cả note hoặc bấm mũi tên và chọn tên-note để ôn lại từ vựng trong note đó. Ở mỗi từ vựng/định nghĩa, các bạn cố gắng nhớ từ/định nghĩa tương ứng là gì, sau đó nhấn Show Answer (hoặc spacebar trên bàn phím). Chọn theo mức độ khó của từ:\nĐỏ - Hard: khó nhớ hoặc không nhớ. Từ/định nghĩa sẽ được hỏi lại sau 1 ngày. Bình thường - Good: tạm thời nhớ. Từ/định nghĩa sẽ được hỏi lại sau 2.5 ngày. Dễ - Easy: Nhớ dễ, nhanh. Từ/định nghĩa sẽ được hỏi lại sau 3.5 ngày. Khoảng 2-3 ngày nên mở lên ôn lại một lần, tới cuối tuần mở lên lần cuối để chắc chắn mình đã thuộc.\n","date":"2023-01-19","permalink":"/posts/obsidian/obsidian-flashcards/","section":"","summary":"Sử dụng ObsidianMD để tạo flash cards.","title":"Obsidian flashcards"},{"content":"","date":"2023-01-19","permalink":"/categories/vocabulary/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"vocabulary"},{"content":"Cần học bao nhiêu từ? Để hiểu được 90% tiếng Anh (hoặc đa số các ngôn ngữ khác) trong ngữ cảnh thường ngày và tiếng Anh công sở (các ngữ cảnh không quá mang tính chuyên ngành), chỉ cần 3000-5000 từ thông dụng (source, source).\nVậy, để học tiếng Anh căn bản một cách nhanh nhất, một phương pháp có thể được áp dụng là tập trung học các từ vựng (và văn phạm) cốt lõi trước.\nTuy nhiên, 90% chưa phải là hiểu hết, sẽ có những lúc học sinh nhầm lẫn hoặc hiểu sai nghĩa của câu. Đối với 10% còn lại, người học cần cố gắng đoán nghĩa của từ vựng thông qua ngữ cảnh. Với 3000 từ, người học có thể hiểu và truyền đạt được đại khái nội dung chính. Với 5000 từ, có thể đoán được nghĩa của một từ lạ thông qua ngữ cảnh với độ chính xác chấp nhận được. Đây cũng là cấp độ người học có thể tự học từ vựng mới thông qua giao tiếp hay truyền thông đa phương tiện.\nTại sao lại nói đến vấn đề này? Bởi vì chỉ cần học với tốc độ 20 từ/ngày, người học chỉ cần 5 tháng để học 3000 từ, 7-8 tháng để học 5000 từ. Vậy, chỉ mất hơn nửa năm để có thể đạt đến trình độ có thể giao tiếp trong ngữ cảnh bình thường và bắt đầu học từ vựng mới một cách thụ động.\nList từ Nếu tìm trên Google, sẽ có rất nhiều list 3000 và 5000 từ \u0026ldquo;thường gặp nhất\u0026rdquo; trong tiếng Anh. Tuy nhiên mình khuyến khích người học chọn list của Oxford vì 1. nó của Oxford và 2. \u0026ldquo;thường gặp nhất\u0026rdquo; không phải là tiêu chí đánh giá duy nhất của Oxford mà còn có các tiêu chí khác để xác định độ quan trọng của mỗi từ vựng. Links:\nOxford 3000 Oxford 5000 Cách học Có rất nhiều cách học từ vựng hiệu quả. Một trong những cách hiệu quả nhất là học theo phương pháp lặp lại ngắt quãng (Spaced Repetition). Phương pháp này đã được nhiều nghiên cứu và thí nghiệm chứng minh rằng nó:\ntăng khả năng cũng như tốc độ nhớ các kiến thức hoặc khái niệm mới tăng thời gian ghi nhớ các kiến thức hoặc khái niệm mới đặc biệt phù hợp với việc học số lượng lớn các khái niệm mới (vd như học từ vựng) Source\nPhương pháp Spaced Repetition thường sử dụng cùng với flashcard. Nguyên lí cốt lõi của phương pháp này là: các kiến thức mới và khó hơn sẽ được lặp lại với tần suất cao hơn so với các kiến thức dễ.\nNgười học có thể tự mua flashcard về rồi viết tay, sau đó tự tìm 1 thuật toán lặp lại ngắt quãng để phân loại từ vựng. Tuy nhiên, cách này rất mất thời gian và công sức. Thay vào đó, mình khuyến khích sử dụng ứng dụng Obsidian để tạo flashcard vì:\nGõ nhanh hơn viết tay Tự áp dụng thuật toán Spaced Repetition (SM-2) Có thể học ở mọi lúc mọi nơi (chỉ cần điện thoại/máy tính) Ứng dụng Obsidian còn có rất nhiều tính năng khác ngoài flashcard Để sử dụng Obsidian, các bạn có thể tải ứng dụng tại đây, sau đó đọc các hướng dẫn về Obsidian trên blog này.\nMorphemes - Từ tố Morphemes - hình thái hay từ tố được định nghĩa là tập hợp chữ cái nhỏ nhất có nghĩa riêng biệt. Có nhiều dạng từ tố, trong đó dạng người học thường thấy quen thuộc nhất là các tiền tố (prefix) và hậu tố (suffix). Mỗi prefix hay suffix đều có nghĩa riêng biệt như: pre- (trước), extra- (thêm, hơn), non- (không), -able/-ible (có thể), -ity/-ty (cái, sự), v.v.\nTrong tiếng Việt, mỗi từ tố phải đứng riêng được, không được dính chung với từ khác. Tuy nhiên, trong tiếng Anh, một từ có thể được cấu tạo từ một hay nhiều từ tố khác nhau.\nTại sao nên học từ tố? Vì từ tố có thể giúp người học tăng vốn từ vựng lên gấp nhiều lần. Ngoài ra, các từ ngữ chuyên ngành hoặc từ ngữ học thuật thường có chứa từ tố gốc Latin hay Hy Lạp, do đó nếu người học nắm các từ tố thường thấy này sẽ dễ đọc hoặc viết các nội dung mang tính khoa học hay học thuật hơn rất nhiều.\nĐây là list các từ tố thông dụng và nghĩa của chúng: Link. Người học có thể học thuộc các từ tố này như học từ vựng bình thường.\n","date":"2023-01-19","permalink":"/posts/english-basics/vocabulary-basic/","section":"","summary":"Làm cách nào để học từ vựng một cách hiệu quả nhất?","title":"Vocabulary"},{"content":"Useful and/or advanced adverbs and conjunctions for academic writing style.\nAdverbs Adverb Meaning Admittedly This probably contradicts what I just said.

Thì cho thấy động từ trong câu xảy ra vào thời gian nào.\nTrong tiếng Anh có bao nhiêu thì? Nhiều ý kiến cho rằng trong tiếng Anh chỉ có 2 thì - quá khứ và không phải quá khứ. Có nhiều người nói rằng trong tiếng Anh có 3 thì - quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai. Có người khác cho rằng có 12 thì - mỗi quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai được chia ra thành 4 thì: đơn, tiếp diễn, hoàn thành, hoàn thành tiếp diễn. Thậm chí có những chuyên gia cho rằng có 16 thì - ngoài 12 thì như đã nói thì có thêm 4 thì điều kiện (conditional).\nLí do là không ai có một định nghĩa chuẩn về thì hết.\nNếu định nghĩa thì theo mặt hình thái - cú pháp học thì chỉ có 2 thì, vì chỉ có 2 thì thỏa mãn việc chia động từ: he goes (hiện tại/tương lai) và he went - các thì có V3 hoặc will không phải là chia động từ (verb conjugation) đơn thuần mà còn có thêm động từ phụ trợ (auxiliary verbs/modal verbs), do đó không được coi là thì.\nCũng theo cách hiểu này, tiếng Việt được xem là ngôn ngữ \u0026ldquo;không có thì\u0026rdquo;. Mặc dù có thể diễn tả thời gian, những ngôn ngữ như tiếng Việt sử dụng các từ riêng biệt để thể hiện thời gian của câu (đã, đang, sẽ), thay vì chia động từ (conjugation) Nếu ta định nghĩa thì theo tất cả \u0026ldquo;loại\u0026rdquo; thời gian có thể diễn tả được trong tiếng Anh thì có thể có được 12-16 thì. V.v. You get the point.\nVấn đề là ai cũng có ý kiến riêng của mình, và ngôn ngữ học là một môn luôn biến đổi - vì ngôn ngữ không bao giờ là bất biến.\nKhi học tiếng Anh, có thể hiểu theo cách nào cũng được. Việc học và hiểu 12 hay 16 thì đã diễn ra hàng chục năm và nhiều thế hệ học sinh có kết quả rất tốt. Tuy nhiên việc nghĩ về các thể động từ (grammatical aspects) như V2 hay V3 riêng biệt với thì (tense) cũng có thể sẽ dễ hiểu, phù hợp với một số người hơn.\nVD: had been doing có thể tách thành had (V2): thì quá khứ - tense been (V3): thể hoàn thành - aspect doing (V-ing): thể tiếp diễn - aspect =\u0026gt; tense + aspect(s) = quá khứ hoàn thành tiếp diễn Tenses \u0026amp; Aspects Quá khứ - Hiện tại - Tương lai - Điều kiện Có 4 thời gian chung có thể diễn tả bằng tiếng Anh:\nQuá khứ Để diễn tả các hành động trong quá khứ. Trong câu phải có V2.\nHiện tại Để diễn tả các hành động ở hiện tại hoặc (trong một số ngữ cảnh đặc biệt) các hành động ở tương lai.\nTương lai Thường thấy nhất là cấu trúc will + V. Để diễn tả các hành động ở tương lai.\nĐiều kiện Điều kiện (conditional) là một dạng thời gian đặc biệt vì nó chỉ những chuyện có thể xảy ra hoặc không. Thường thấy nhất ở dạng if (then).\nTiếp diễn - Hoàn thành Và 2 thể động từ liên quan đến thời gian:\nTiếp diễn Dùng để diễn tả một hành động đã, đang, hoặc sẽ đang diễn ra ở một thời điểm nhất định. Một hành động đang diễn ra là hành động đã bắt đầu nhưng chưa kết thúc.\nMột khác biệt đáng chú ý giữa tiếp diễn và thì đơn là các thì đơn thường chỉ hành động \u0026ldquo;luôn xảy ra\u0026rdquo; hoặc \u0026ldquo;lặp đi lặp lại\u0026rdquo; trong thời gian dài, trong khi đó các thì tiếp diễn thường có tính tạm thời, ám chỉ hành động sẽ có kết thúc.\nTất cả thì tiếp diễn đều phải có to be + V-ing.\nHoàn thành Các thì hoàn thành dùng để diễn tả một hành động xảy ra từ trước nhưng có ảnh hưởng ở thời gian của câu. Thường thì cấu trúc hoàn thành tập trung vào ảnh hưởng hay kết quả của hành động thay vì tập trung vào việc hành động xảy ra.\nVD: I have done all my homework. - mặc dù có thông tin về một hành động đã xảy ra từ trước, nhưng câu này ý muốn thu hút sự chú ý vào kết quả - đã làm xong bài tập - chứ không phải vào việc làm lúc nào. Một nhầm lẫn thường gặp là không phân biệt được hoàn thành và kết thúc. Cấu trúc hoàn thành ám chỉ rằng tới thời điểm của câu, chuyện đó đã hoàn thành chứ không phải hành động đó sẽ kết thúc sau câu nói.\nVD: I have lived in London for three years. - ám chỉ rằng tới thời điểm hiện tại (thời điểm của câu nói - hiện tại), tôi đã hoàn thành 3 năm sống ở London chứ không phải tôi đã sống ở London 3 năm và tôi sẽ không sống ở London nữa (hành động sống ở London không kết thúc). Tất cả thì hoàn thành đều phải có to have + past participle (V3).\n","date":"2023-01-18","permalink":"/posts/english-basics/tenses-basic/","section":"","summary":"Giải thích chung về các thì trong tiếng Anh.","title":"Tenses"},{"content":"Gốc từ Morpheme - gốc từ:\nLà tập hợp chữ cái nhỏ nhất có nghĩa riêng biệt liên quan đến từ VD: univers-ity - gốc từ -ity nghĩa là danh từ (noun modifier) VD: beau-ti-ful (adj) beau: từ gốc latin = đẹp ty: gốc từ danh từ ful: gốc từ tính từ VD: bio-chemis-try bio: gốc từ nghĩa sự sống chem: gốc từ nghĩa hóa học try: gốc từ nghĩa môn học =\u0026gt; biochemistry: sinh hóa học VD: tele-vis-ion tele: từ xa vis: gốc từ nghĩa liên quan tới nhìn ion: gốc từ danh từ VD: telephone, telemarketing, nightvision Có nhiều gốc từ có nghĩa đơn giản như \u0026ldquo;biến thành động từ\u0026rdquo; hay \u0026ldquo;biến thành danh từ\u0026rdquo;, nhưng cũng có nhiều gốc từ nghĩa phức tại như \u0026ldquo;hóa (học)\u0026rdquo; hay \u0026ldquo;từ xa\u0026rdquo;.

Ice cream is eaten by me. là câu bị động. Câu 1: I (S1) eat (V1) ice cream (O1). Câu 2: Ice cream (S2) is eaten (V2) by me (o2). Để đổi chủ động sang bị động: S1=O2, S2=O1, đổi V1 sang V2 theo cấu trúc, giữ nguyên thì tense 1 = tense 2. Câu bị động dùng khi muốn nhấn mạnh người hoặc vật bị tác động hoặc không biết người hoặc vật làm ra hành động.\nCấu trúc câu Mệnh đề Mệnh đề thường là 1 cụm chủ ngữ + động từ. (S+V).\nTrong môn ngữ văn hay học rằng mệnh đề là chủ ngữ + vị ngữ. Vị ngữ tiếng Anh là Predicate. Vị ngữ chỉ là tất cả thành phần trong câu không phải chủ ngữ. Trong mỗi vị ngữ bắt buộc phải có ít nhất 1 động từ.\nCâu Trong một câu phải có ít nhất 1 mệnh đề = 1 chủ ngữ + 1 động từ.\nCâu có 1 mệnh đề là câu đơn Câu có từ 2 mệnh đề trở lên là câu phức Từ loại 4 loại từ quan trọng nhất:\ndanh từ (noun) động từ (verb) tính từ (adjective) trạng từ (adverb, thường kết thúc bằng -ly) Tính từ dùng để bổ nghĩa cho danh từ. Trạng từ bổ nghĩa cho động từ, tính từ, hoặc trạng từ khác.\nCác loại từ khác:\ngiới từ (preposition) từ nối (conjunction) đại từ (pronoun) mạo từ (article) chỉ từ (determiner) Thành phần câu Chủ ngữ (S) là người hoặc vật điều khiển động từ. Trong câu chủ động, chủ ngữ là người hoặc vật làm ra hành động. Trong câu bị động, chủ ngữ là người hoặc vật bị tác động bởi hành động.\nTân ngữ (O) là người hoặc vật bị ảnh hưởng bởi động từ.\nĐộng từ Động từ trong tiếng Anh luôn có ít nhất 3 thể: V1, V2, V3.\nV1: thể nguyên mẫu V2: thể quá khứ đơn V3: quá khứ phân từ quá khứ phân từ dùng trong cấu trúc bị động và các thì hoàn thành Ngoài ra còn có hiện tại phân từ \u0026amp; danh động từ. Phân từ Hiện tại phân từ: V-ing Quá khứ phân từ: V3 Phân từ dùng để thể hiện thì và làm tính từ.\nVD: bore (v): làm cho chán boring (adj): chán bored (adj): cảm giác chán I\u0026rsquo;m boring: tôi là một người nhàm chán. I\u0026rsquo;m bored: Tôi cảm thấy chán. Động từ bất quy tắc Đa số động từ trong tiếng Anh để đổi sang V2 hay V3 chỉ cần thêm -ed. Riêng các động từ bất quy tắc đổi khác, phải học thuộc.
