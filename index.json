In others, children focus on a narrow range of subjects related to a particular career. Which do you think is appropriate in today‚Äôs world? (Education)\nThere is an ongoing debate about the number of subjects students in secondary schools should learn. While some suggest a wide range of curriculum, others believe firmly that the subjects taught should be directly related to students\u0026rsquo; future careers.\nAt their age, many students are not informed enough to make decisions about their future career. This is exemplified by the fact that a large number of undergraduates change their majors every year. Although society may view them as fully-functioning adults capable of making major life decisions, psychologically speaking, the majority of 18-year-olds are still going through the process of self-discovery and thus are ill-equipped to choose the perfect career path that would maximize their potential. As a result, many would argue that restricting students to a narrow range of subjects would not necessarily benefit their adult lives, and could even be counter-productive in some cases.\nBy having access to a multitude of fields and disciplines, learners would have more opportunities to discover what they are passionate about. As each individual is different, some students would be better suited to a career in finance, while others would flourish in more artistic environments, and so on. Being exposed to different areas of learning has merits beyond their professional lives, too. Students can lead a more fulfilling life by learning about new passions and hobbies that may not have monetary value but are nonetheless entertaining and rewarding to pursue. Society must come to terms with the increased individualism of the modern age and the fact that people need interests outside of work in order to be truly satisfied. The availability of multiple fields of knowledge is therefore beneficial not only to the students who learn them but also to society at large.\nIn conclusion, students should not be limited to a predefined list of subjects that people deem important because the alternative is far superior and has many more upsides.\n(317 words, band 7)\n","date":"2023-02-04","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/range-of-subjects-sample/","section":"","summary":"In some countries, secondary schools aim to provide a general education across a range of subjects.

What are the reasons and solutions? (Environment)\nIn the post-modern era, the effects of environmental changes have become a pressing issue. One of the ways people can minimize their environmental impacts is through recycling. Sadly, in many nations and regions around the world, waste recycling is often overlooked.\nA large number of people do not take recycling seriously enough. Hundreds of thousands of tons of garbage head to landfills and incinerators every day, contributing greatly to air, water, and soil degradation. Many experts see this as an issue of awareness: the majority of these people are simply not cognizant of the damage they cause through their lack of recycling. Many others are somewhat conscious of the harmful effects of their actions, but fail to see the full picture and do not see the value in recycling or reusing materials. Therefore, solutions to this problem should be aimed at raising awareness of the problem and the ease of recycling, or giving people fewer opportunities to damage the environment.\nThere are a myriad of ways to encourage recycling. More specifically, at the federal level, there should be campaigns and legislation to combat environmental damage. The benefits and methods of recycling and reusing materials should be taught to all schoolchildren, and the disadvantages should be laid out clearly through national advertisements or newspapers. Furthermore, there should be laws mandating the separation of recyclable from non-recyclable waste. In some countries like Japan, residents must buy different trash bags for different types of garbage, and categorize their waste accordingly or risk facing fines. These, when combined with other measures, would inevitably reduce the amount of unnecessary waste dumped out into the environment.\nIn conclusion, a big contributor to the deficiency in waste recycling is a lack of awareness. To remedy this, steps should be taken at the government level.\n(296 words, band 7)\n","date":"2023-02-03","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/recycling-solutions-sample/","section":"","summary":"In some countries, there is not enough recycling of waste materials (e.g. paper, glass and cans).

Do the advantages of this trend outweigh its disadvantages?\nIn the Western world, the majority of fresh graduates choose to move out of their parents\u0026rsquo; house and start their independent lives. In contrast, Eastern adults usually live with their parents until they get married, even if they have found jobs and can afford to live alone. There are advantages and disadvantages to both of these approaches.\nThere are many upsides to living with one\u0026rsquo;s parents. Perhaps most notably, young people can retain their support system. Since the day their children were born, parents have stood behind their children and would continue to do so with no strings attached. Since residing alone is more costly than living with roommates, this will financially benefit young people by reducing living expenses. There are other merits as well, such as emotional support during tough times, or a lessened load of household tasks. Consequently, many Asian people opt to stay with their parents until the need to move out arises, such as when they start their own families.\nThe parents in this equation reap some benefits as well. Beyond the aforementioned psychological and economic benefits that go both ways in this living arrangement, parents also get to spend a longer amount of time with their sons and daughters before they leave the nest. Furthermore, as they get older, having caregivers when their health deteriorates is a major comfort, especially when those caregivers are family. Thus, the cohabitation of parents and children is a mutually beneficial relationship.\nAdmittedly, there are some downsides to living with your parents. As adults, everyone in the household will have their own opinions and personalities. From time to time, these opinions and personalities may clash, and when they do, these familial conflicts are harder to resolve than others, perhaps even more so when everybody is living under the same roof. Nevertheless, these drawbacks can easily go away if everyone adjusts their expectations and allows each other some room for understanding. Thereby, the negative aspects of parents and children living together can be mostly mitigated.\nIn conclusion, although the choice to live with one\u0026rsquo;s parents, even when one can afford to move out, comes with certain complications, they are far outweighed by the potential benefits.\n(363 words, band 6.5)\n","date":"2023-02-02","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/adults-living-with-parents-sample/","section":"","summary":"In some countries, more and more adults choose to continue to live with their parents after they graduate and have found jobs.

This blog will mainly contain methods, tools, and resources for language acquisition, with the occasional personal blog post here and there. The language I\u0026rsquo;m teaching is English, but hopefully learners of other languages can find something useful here, too.\nWhy a blog I\u0026rsquo;m an English teacher/tutor, and I find myself wanting a permanent place to store and present my ideas.\nMy first blog was created with Ghost CMS, which was an excellent option. I hosted NEOLINGO on a VPS I rented and used BunnyCDN for caching. It was acceptably fast and optimized.\nHowever, I had 2 problems with this setup\nThe writing process on Ghost was only okay-ish, since I had to use their web interface to write and publish posts. Instead, I wanted a way to write and edit posts offline, using whatever writing tool I prefer. It\u0026rsquo;s faster, more convenient, and my workflow can be customized to my liking. Hosting costs. I had to rent a Virtual Private Server in the cloud, since Ghost CMS doesn\u0026rsquo;t play nice with shared hosting. Renting regional servers in Asia was more costly compared to servers in NA or EU, but servers in those regions are far away and thus performance suffers. This necessitated the use of a caching layer, for which I chose BunnyCDN, but that costs money too. Enter static site generators. Static sites are blazing fast and extremely lightweight, which makes the reading experience more enjoyable. More importantly, static site hosting is cheap or even free - since they\u0026rsquo;re so lightweight, which reduces my hosting costs. This blog is written in ObsidianMD, built using Hugo, and deployed via Netlify. All of these tools are free (for now), and writing in Obsidian is far better than writing in Ghost editor.\n","date":"2023-02-01","permalink":"/page/about/","section":"Pages","summary":"Welcome to NEOLINGO, a blog about language learning.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"2023-02-01","permalink":"/page/","section":"Pages","summary":"","title":"Pages"},{"content":"Some people think that using mobile phones and computers has a negative effect on young people\u0026rsquo;s reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nDigital devices such as phones and computers have been adopted worldwide, to the point where everybody now has at least one digital accessory that they use every day. However, some people, especially older generations, are of the opinion that this widespread adoption of technology is detrimental to the reading and writing proficiency of young people.\nThe theory that as technological literacy increases, proficiency in other skills decreases is quite prominent. Many people feel that as children and teenagers become addicted to their mobile devices, the development of valuable skills such as reading comprehension and creative writing is neglected. This is amplified by the fact that an alarming number of publications and social networks nowadays only care about the pure amount of clicks and views they can generate, and thus churn out meaningless, poorly-written posts and articles that are only designed to do just that - generate views. Hence, not only are reading and writing skills are not developed, they are actively made worse due to the consumption of bad content.\nNevertheless, this theory loses credibility somewhat when we look at the bigger picture. In many countries, the literacy rate is higher than ever before, and the amount of well-written books and articles have also increased significantly, albeit alongside poorly-written ones. Advances in user-friendly, accessible technology have made both learning and teaching easier, and people are becoming more and more well-educated as a result. Consequently, we can conclude that while there are admittedly some downsides to the heavy usage of mobile phones and computers, the overall impact it has on reading and writing skills is mostly positive and beneficial.\nTo summarise, though some people may think that the widespread adoption of devices like phones and computers negatively impacts reading and writing proficiency, this can be disproven when we look at the wider effect digital gadgets has had, especially regarding education.\n(307 words, band 7)\n","date":"2023-02-01","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/phone-effects-reading-writing/","section":"","summary":"Some people think that using mobile phones and computers has a negative effect on young people\u0026rsquo;s reading and writing skills.

To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Government)\nThe government budget and how to best utilize it has always been a contentious issue - because it is of a limited nature, it is crucial that we spend the budget as effectively as possible. Hence, when it comes to promoting sports and art, there are two prevalent school of thoughts: promoting them in school, and promoting them in communities.\nSchools are great places to foster sports and art, due to their inherent design as places of education. Promoting these extra-curriculum activities within an educational setting allows society to cultivate talents from a young age. What\u0026rsquo;s more, it enriches the lives of students, who would be given the opportunity to follow their interests and passions, and improve upon them. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find many flaws or downside to this approach. Everyone wins here - from students who are given the chance to develop themselves and to society in general, as we can better find and nurture talents.\nHowever, one should not overlook the effectiveness of promoting sports and art in communities, or the life improvement it brings. People who previously have not had the chance to discover their gifts or interests can do so, and thereby their lives and perhaps even society at large benefits from it. Firstly, we can both provide entertainment and inspire people to follow their passion, thereby discovering whether there are wasted or under-developed potential within themselves. Secondly, even if the number of transcendental or generational talents are few and far between, at least people can now lead happier and more fulfilling lives, which makes our society more productive as a whole. Therefore, it is equally important that we also find the opportunity to foster sports and art development in our local communities.\nIn conclusion, sports and art promotion is an important endeavour for any government around the world, and choosing between school or community promotion can be tough. That said, one should realize that it is not an either-or issue, and that we should strive to provide everyone, in every setting, with the opportunity to grow and advance not only their gifts but also their interests.\n(353 words, band 7-7.5)\n","date":"2023-01-31","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/promoting-sports-and-art-sample/","section":"","summary":"The government should spend money in promoting sport and art in school, rather than sponsoring professional sports and art events in communities.

To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Education)\nSince TV and computer games first became widely available to the public in the 20th century, people have claimed that playing computer games is detrimental to children, and that they should preferably read books instead. Be that as it may, as television and computer games develop and become more and more widespread, plenty of research has been done on the subject and they seem to suggest that watching TV and playing computer games may have at least some benefits.\nOpponents of digital entertainment insist that it ruins childhoods and that books are more beneficial to young minds. Indeed, when consumed without moderation, computers and TVs can be addictive and thus prevent children from doing other beneficial activities - such as playing sports, studying or socializing - all of which are fundamental in shaping a child\u0026rsquo;s development. Books, on the other hand, are far less addictive while being potentially every bit as entertaining as their digital alternatives. Nonetheless, these possible negative outcomes is only tangentially related to digital media itself; rather, they point to deeper problems such as the lack of self-control or inattentive caretakers. In other words, the undesirable impact of degital entertainment like television and computer games comes from excessive consumption, not from the medium. Thus, it is perhaps more practical to look past these purported downsides of digital media and determine if there are benefits to be had when compared to traditional book reading.\nThere are, in fact, numerous benefits that children can gain when playing video games. Researchers have observed a correlation between gaming and improved hand-eye coordination, forward planning and critical thinking. Furthermore, by design, television, movies, and video games are more immersive and compelling as story-telling devices - especially to young children. Because of the shorter attention span of children, the increased engagement can prove invaluable for educators and guardians in their efforts. Therefore, in certain situations and contexts, reading books is not necessarily better than watching television or playing computer games.\nIn conclusion, while books are undeniably a valuable tool in education and in children\u0026rsquo;s upbringing, one should not overlook the potential benefits of digital media such as television and video games, provided that they are consumed reasonably and responsibly.\n(363 words, band 7)\n","date":"2023-01-30","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/books-vs-tv-sample/","section":"","summary":"Some people think reading stories in books is better than watching TV or playing computer games for children. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Education)","title":"Books vs TV - Sample"},{"content":"Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\nComputer games are said to be almost as old as computers themselves. However, the effect of computer games on the development of children is still unclear and hotly debated. While some say that computer games negatively affect children and should be avoided at all costs, others believe that computer games have a role to play in the development of children in the modern world.\nComputer games, like everything else, have many downsides, especially for children. Extended and unsupervised gaming sessions can cause many issues, ranging from physical ones such as nearsightedness and joint pain to psychological ones like addiction. These problems have the potential to adversely (=negatively) impact the lives of anyone, but they are especially damaging to children in their formative years. As such, excessive gaming is generally frowned upon by health experts, and it is recommended that parents should both limit the amount of time their children spend playing video games and keep an eye on the games they play.\nHowever, computer games may also bring benefits to the development of children. Various studies were able to measure a considerable increase in hand-eye coordination in children who spend at least some of their time playing video games compared to their peers who don\u0026rsquo;t play at all. Some games, such as strategy or puzzle games, can even teach children critical thinking and forward planning. Needless to say, these are beneficial skills and traits that can help children blossom and develop. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are also physical and mental benefits of computer games that can positively contribute to children\u0026rsquo;s growth.\nIn conclusion, while there are undoubtedly many potential problems that computer games can cause, they mainly stem from excessive and uncontrolled gaming. On the other hand, choosing the right games and playing them in moderation can have a lot of positive impact on children\u0026rsquo;s development.\n(309 words, band 6.5-7.0)\n","date":"2023-01-29","permalink":"/posts/sample-essays/computer-games-pros-cons-sample/","section":"","summary":"Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect.
