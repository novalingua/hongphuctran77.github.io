The government budget and how to best utilize it has always been a <mark>contentious issue</mark> - because it is of a limited nature, it is crucial that we spend the budget as effectively as possible. Hence, when it comes to promoting sports and art, there are two prevalent school of thoughts: promoting them in school, and promoting them in communities.

Schools are great places to foster sports and art, due to their <mark>inherent</mark> design as places of education. Promoting these extra-curriculum activities within an <mark>educational setting</mark> allows society to <mark>cultivate</mark> talents from a young age. What's more, it <mark>enriches</mark> the lives of students, who would be given the opportunity to follow their interests and passions, and improve upon them. Indeed, one would <mark>be hard pressed to</mark> find many flaws or downside to this approach. Everyone wins here - from students who are given the chance to develop themselves and to society in general, as we can better find and nurture talents.

However, one should not <mark>overlook</mark> the effectiveness of promoting sports and art in communities, or the life improvement it brings. People who previously have not had the chance to discover their gifts or interests can do so, and thereby their lives and perhaps even society at large benefits from it. Firstly, we can both provide entertainment and inspire people to follow their passion, thereby discovering whether there are wasted or under-developed potential within themselves. Secondly, even if the number of <mark>transcendental</mark> or <mark>generational</mark> talents are <mark>few and far between</mark>, at least people can now lead happier and more fulfilling lives, which makes our society more productive as a whole. Therefore, it is equally important that we also find the opportunity to foster sports and art development in our local communities.

In conclusion, sports and art promotion is an important <mark>endeavour</mark> for any government around the world, and choosing between school or community promotion can be tough. That said, one should realize that it is not an <mark>either-or issue</mark>, and that we should <mark>strive to</mark> provide everyone, in every setting, with the opportunity to grow and advance not only their gifts but also their interests.
