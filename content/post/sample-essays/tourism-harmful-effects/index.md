Many view tourism as a <mark>double-edged sword</mark>. There are both advantages and disadvantages to allowing or encouraging international visitors to your country, and many nations hold the opinion that it does more harm than good.

The main reason for this line of thinking is the <mark>stark contrast</mark> between <mark>conservatism</mark> and <mark>liberalism</mark> among countries. Ideologies around the world differ greatly, especially between Western and Eastern or Middle Eastern countries - Western countries tend to be more <mark>liberal and democratic</mark>, whereas countries such as those in the Arab world are mostly <mark>right-leaning</mark>. As such, many feel that their way of life is threatened by the introduction of other cultures. Consequently, conservative countries tend to favor international tourism less.

The <mark>remedy</mark> for this situation is twofold: actions should be taken by both the visited countries and the tourists themselves. Firstly, traditionalist countries should embrace the mindset of wider <mark>acceptance and tolerance</mark>. The integration and evolution of cultures is a generally positive development, and will surely happen whether there is a <mark>bustling</mark> tourism industry or not. Secondly, tourists need to <mark>be mindful of</mark> their hosts' country traditions and customs. As guests, they may not be fully aware of the <mark>accepted norms and behaviors</mark> at their travel destination. Nevertheless, visitors should at least make some effort towards understanding foreign cultures and customs they <mark>encounter</mark>, and always respect them as a part of the locals' identity. As the two sides become more open toward one another, a middle ground can be reached, and there will be benefits for both countries and tourists.

In conclusion, the <mark>bias against</mark> international tourism held in some countries is due to the divide between the left and right <mark>ideologies</mark> of the <mark>political spectrum</mark>. To combat this, efforts must be made by both the host nations and tourists.
