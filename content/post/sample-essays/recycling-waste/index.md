In the <mark>post-modern era</mark>, the effects of environmental changes have become a pressing issue. One of the ways people can <mark>minimize</mark> their environmental impacts is through recycling. Sadly, in many nations and regions around the world, waste recycling is often overlooked.

A large number of people do not take recycling seriously enough. Hundreds of thousands of tons of garbage head to landfills and incinerators every day, contributing greatly to air, water, and soil degradation. Many experts <mark>see this as</mark> an issue of awareness: the majority of these people are simply not <mark>cognizant of</mark> the damage they cause through their lack of recycling. Many others are somewhat <mark>conscious of</mark> the harmful effects of their actions, but fail to see <mark>the full picture</mark> and do not see the value in recycling or reusing materials. Therefore, solutions to this problem should <mark>be aimed at</mark> raising awareness of the problem and the ease of recycling, or giving people fewer opportunities to damage the environment.

There are <mark>a myriad of</mark> ways to encourage recycling. More specifically, <mark>at the federal level</mark>, there should be campaigns and <mark>legislation</mark> to combat environmental damage. The benefits and methods of recycling and reusing materials should be taught to all schoolchildren, and the disadvantages should be laid out clearly through national advertisements or newspapers. Furthermore, there should be laws <mark>mandating</mark> the separation of recyclable from non-recyclable waste. In some countries like Japan, residents must buy different trash bags for different types of garbage, and categorize their waste accordingly or risk facing fines. These, when combined with other <mark>measures</mark>, would <mark>inevitably</mark> reduce the amount of unnecessary waste dumped out into the environment.

In conclusion, a big contributor to the <mark>deficiency</mark> in waste recycling is a lack of awareness. To <mark>remedy</mark> this, steps should be taken at the government level.
