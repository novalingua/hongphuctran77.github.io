Many people, especially those in Western countries, opt into gap years to travel or get some real-world experiences after they have finished secondary education. This phenomenon has both advantages and disadvantages.

A gap year can be an excellent way for <mark>adolescents</mark> to prepare for adulthood. They get to take a break from studying and their academic obligations and have time to discover their passions and interests. For instance, students who have plans to get jobs in certain fields can try out their chosen profession through <mark>entry-level jobs</mark> or internships. Even if it is <mark>in a limited capacity</mark>, they usually <mark>accrue</mark> a good amount of experience and as such can more easily make informed decisions about their choice of occupation. Soon-to-be <mark>undergraduates</mark> that lack the desire to work may instead spend their time travelling. On these journeys, they would be able to gain valuable <mark>soft skills</mark> and life experiences, <mark>immerse themselves in</mark> foreign cultures, or perhaps even make lifelong connections with people and places. In any case, gap years are opportunities for people to acquire invaluable experiences that they otherwise would not have been able to obtain. Nevertheless, spending a year <mark>absent from</mark> school may not be a good choice for a multitude of reasons.

For several people, gap years would <mark>equate to</mark> wasted time. Firstly, they would lose the discipline and academic <mark>aptitude</mark> that they have built up over a long time. Taking a break from school also means taking a break from the learning and studying routine they have become so used to, which may result in a decrease in <mark>scholastic</mark> abilities when they return to school later on. Secondly, even though the experiences one may gain during their gap year are undoubtedly useful, <mark>the same can also be said</mark> for the ability to finish out one's education a year earlier. After all, completing their degrees on time compared to those who take gap years means getting <mark>a head start</mark> in their careers. Thus, the decision whether to spend a year working or travelling before moving on to <mark>tertiary education</mark> is purely <mark>a matter of personal preference</mark>, as there are both upsides and downsides that carry varying weights for different individuals.

In conclusion, gap years can be beneficial, but they also have <mark>a plethora of</mark> possible downsides that each person should consider <mark>prior to</mark> making their decision.
