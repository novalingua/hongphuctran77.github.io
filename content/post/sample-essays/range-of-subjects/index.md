There is an <mark>ongoing debate</mark> about the number of subjects students in secondary schools should learn. While some suggest a wide range of curriculum, others believe firmly that the subjects taught should be directly related to students' future careers.

At their age, many students are not informed enough to make decisions about their future career. This is <mark>exemplified by</mark> the fact that a large number of <mark>undergraduates</mark> change their majors every year. Although society may view them as <mark>fully-functioning adults</mark> capable of making major life decisions, psychologically speaking, the majority of 18-year-olds are still going through the process of self-discovery and thus are <mark>ill-equipped</mark> to choose the perfect career path that would maximize their potential. As a result, many would argue that restricting students to a narrow range of subjects would not necessarily benefit their adult lives, and could even be <mark>counter-productive</mark> in some cases.

By having access to a multitude of fields and <mark>disciplines</mark>, learners would have more opportunities to discover what they are passionate about. As each individual is different, some students would be better suited to a career in finance, while others would <mark>flourish</mark> in more artistic environments, and so on. <mark>Being exposed to</mark> different areas of learning has merits beyond their professional lives, too. Students can lead a more fulfilling life by learning about new passions and hobbies that may not have <mark>monetary value</mark> but are <mark>nonetheless</mark> entertaining and rewarding to pursue. Society must come to terms with the increased individualism of the modern age and the fact that people need interests outside of work in order to be truly satisfied. The <mark>availability</mark> of multiple fields of knowledge is therefore beneficial not only to the students who learn them but also to society at large.

In conclusion, students should not be limited to a <mark>predefined list</mark> of subjects that people deem important because <mark>the alternative</mark> is far superior and has many more upsides.
