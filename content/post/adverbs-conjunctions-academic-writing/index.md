## Adverbs

| Adverb         | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admittedly     | This probably contradicts what I just said.                                                               |
| Apparently     | This is something I believe to be true or have heard, although I’m not certain it is correct.             |
| Fortunately    | This is something positive which contrasts with something else I have said/heard. I am pleased with this. |
| Frankly        | This is my true opinion, although it may be shocking.                                                     |
| Understandably | One can sympathize with this.                                                                             |
| Astonishingly  | Like surprisingly.                                                                                        |
| Undoubtedly    | This is 100% certain.                                                                                     |
| Indubitably    | Same as undoubtedly.                                                                                      |
| Realistically  | In a way that demonstrates a *sensible and practical* idea of what can be achieved or expected.           |
| Undeniably     | Most certainly.                                                                                           |
| Interestingly  | This deserves attention.                                                                                  |
| Naturally      | Of course.                                                                                                |
| Evidently      | Obviously                                                                                                 |
| Fundamentally  | In a way that is deep and at the most basic.                                                              |
| Absolutely     | Used to emphasize a strong or exaggerated statement.                                                                                                          |
| Approximately  | Used to show that something is almost, but not completely, accurate or exact; roughly.                                                                                                          |
| Distinctly     | (used for emphasis) In a way that is very noticeable or apparent; decidedly.                                                                                                          |
| Tremendously   | To a very great extent.                                                                                                          |
| Considerably   | To a great extent.                                                                                                          |
| Greatly        | To a great extent.                                                                                                          |
| Seemingly      | As far as you know.                                                                                                          |
| Consequently   | For that reason.                                                                                                          |

## Conjunctions

| Conjunction  | Meaning                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Therefore    | For that reason                                                                                                                        |
| Nevertheless | In spite of that                                                                                                                       |
| Nonetheless  | In spite of that                                                                                                                       |
| Meanwhile    | At the same time                                                                                                                       |
| Since        | Because                                                                                                                                |
| Whereas      | In contrast or comparison with the fact you just said                                                                                  |
| Wherein      | In which                                                                                                                               |
| Yet          | However                                                                                                                                |
| Indeed       | Used to emphasize a description, typically of a quality or condition/Used to introduce a further and stronger or more surprising point |
| In fact      | Used to emphasize the truth of an assertion, especially one contrary to what might be expected or what has been asserted.              |
| Hence        | For that reason                                                                                                                        |
| Furthermore  | In addition                                                                                                                            |
| Accordingly  | In a way that is appropriate to the particular circumstances/Consequently, Therefore                                                   |
| Instead      | In place of                                                                                                                            |
| Likewise     | In the same way                                                                                                                                       |
