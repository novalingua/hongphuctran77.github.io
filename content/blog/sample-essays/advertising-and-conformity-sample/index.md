Nowadays, people are <mark>bombarded with</mark> advertisements everywhere - from ads on their way to work to ads on their phones and computers. Meanwhile, there is a <mark>sentiment</mark> that the overwhelming number of promotions is eroding our individualism, making us buy, use, and wear the same things. This is a sentiment that I generally agree with.

There are a handful of brands that dominate their respective industries and thereby possess an <mark>outsized</mark> amount of <mark>marketing power</mark>, leaving consumers with fewer choices. The advertisements from <mark>industry titans</mark> such as Nike and Adidas for athletic shoes, Coca-Cola and Pepsi for carbonated drinks, and Gucci, Channel and a few others for <mark>luxury consumer goods</mark> are often accompanied by much higher <mark>brand value and recognition</mark>, wider appeal and reach, and stimulates more purchases from consumers. Hence, for these highly centralized industries, customers mostly purchase and use the same set of apparels advertised to them <mark>via various channels</mark>. These clothes and gears are mainly designed to fit as many people as possible, rather than products that are more specifically <mark>geared towards</mark> different individuals. This <mark>conformity</mark> of purchasing habit is <mark>eating away</mark> at people's uniqueness and individuality.

This is <mark>compounded by</mark> the fact that for the vast majority of people, the advertisements they consume are astonishingly similar. Due to yet more <mark>centralization</mark> in social media and search engines - with Facebook, Youtube and Google's dominance almost reaching <mark>monopolistic</mark> levels - the majority of <mark>promotional materials</mark> served to people would be on these platforms. Thus, the aforementioned advertisements reach a wider audience than ever before, gaining even more influence on the purchases that consumers make. This <mark>amplifies</mark> the similarity of products that people buy and wear, <mark>worsening</mark> the lack of originality in society. Together, the power of advertising from certain brands and the <mark>anti-competitiveness</mark> of social media platforms and search engines are making everyone <mark>converge on</mark> the same looks and the same accessories and gadgets that we use in our daily lives.

In conclusion, advertisements play a major role in encouraging the lack of distinctiveness, personalization, and individuality, due to the domination of a few big players and the <mark>duopoly</mark> of online advertisement between Facebook and Google.
