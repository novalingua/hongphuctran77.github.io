## Welcome to NEOLINGO!

This blog mainly contains methods, tools, and resources for language acquisition, with the occasional personal blog post here and there. The language I'm teaching is English, but hopefully learners of other languages can find something useful here, too.

A list of all posts can be found [here](https://neolingo.net/page/archives/). If you're looking for something specific, all my posts are neatly categorized [here](https://neolingo.net/categories/).
